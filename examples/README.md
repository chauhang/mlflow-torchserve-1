This folder contains there different examples as shown below

1.`IrisClassification` -  Demonstrates distributed training (DDP) and deployment using Iris Dataset and MLflow-torchserve plugin with `MLflow cli` commands.

2.`Iris_TorchScript` -   Demonstrates saving TorchScript version of the Iris Classification model and deployment of the same using MLflow-torchserve plugin with `MLflow cli` commands.

3.`MNIST` - Demonstrates training of MNIST handwritten digit recognition and deployment of the model using MLflow-torchserve **python plugin**

4.`TextClassification` - Demonstrates training of TextClassification example and deployment of the model using using MLflow-torchserve **python plugin**

5.`BertNewClassification`-Demonstrates a workflow using a pytorch based BERT model.
                           The example illustrates,
                           a.) model training (fine tuning a pre-trained model), 
                           b.)logging of model,summary, parameters and extra files at the end of training
                           c.)deployment of the  model in TorchServe
